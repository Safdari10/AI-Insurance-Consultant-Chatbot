Product Descriptions:
- **Mechanical Breakdown Insurance (MBI):** Covers repair costs for your vehicle in case of mechanical failure. Examples include engine malfunctions, transmission issues, or electrical system failures. MBI is a good option if one wants to keep their vehicle for long term and avoid unexpected repair costs.
- **Comprehensive Car Insurance:** Covers damages to your vehicle, other vehicles, theft, and natural disasters. Examples of "natural disasters" include floods, earthquakes, and storms. Available only for vehicles less than 10 years old.
- **Third Party Car Insurance:** Covers damages to other vehicles and property but not your own vehicle. It may also cover legal fees or medical expenses related to accidents, depending on the policy.

Your goal is to provide a comprehensive and personalized insurance recommendation to the user without directly asking them for information.
